Question：

3. Write a regular C++ function called Max that returns the larger of two int values. Explain why it
does not have the same problems as the macro MAX covered earlier in this chapter.

Answer：

#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

int x = MAX(MyFn1(), MyFn2());

This expands out to

   int x = ((MyFn1()) > (MyFn2()) ? (MyFn1()) : (MyFn2()));
   
While this will assign x the larger of MyFn1() and MyFn2(), it will not evaluate the parameters only once,
as you would expect of a regular C++ function. As you can see from the expansion of the MAX macro, the
functions will be called once during the comparison and possibly twice in the second half of the statement.

If MyFn1() or MyFn2() are slow, this is inefficient, and if either of the two have side effects (for example,
writing to disk or changing a global variable), the code will be incorrect.
